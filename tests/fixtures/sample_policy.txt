The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) has issued a new guideline on capital adequacy. 
Institutions must maintain a tier-one capital buffer equal to 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets. 
OSFI will begin assessing compliance on January 1 2026. 
Summary reports must be submitted within 45 days of each fiscal quarter. 
Failure to comply may result in administrative penalties. 
The guideline replaces the 2022 interim advisory.
